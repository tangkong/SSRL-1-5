  IP networking diagram for the High Throughput system.  Note: Originally, 
  192.0.2.2 was the local IP for SPEC computers to talk to detector computers 
  â€“ or more specifically, to map drives (EXPORT).  This was so that Pilatus 
  detectors could move between beam lines easily.  Pilatus detector computers 
  were sequentially numbered by 10's (eg. 192.0.2.10, 192.0.2.20) but that 
  scheme is no longer followed by MSD group. (ie: ... 91 instead of 90.)
