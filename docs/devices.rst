A variety of devices are available for use at SSRL-1-5.  Currently only 
High Throughput (HiTp) diffraction is supported, but more functionality will
be added in the future.  Examples here will utilize basic Bluesky plans, which 
may be too verbose for the average user.  More specialized plans will be covered
in the :doc:`plans` section
